## Analyzing Body Mass Data of Gentoo Penguins

**Objective:** We will analyze body mass data of Gentoo penguins using R, perform normality tests, compare body masses between males and females, interpret the results, and visualize the data.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Load the dataset and filter it to include only Gentoo penguins (`species == "Gentoo"`).**

2.  **Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test (`shapiro.test()`) to check the normality of body mass (`body_mass_g`) for Gentoo penguins.**

3.  **Separately, perform Shapiro-Wilk tests for body mass (`bill_length_mm`) of male and female Gentoo penguins.**

4.  **Interpret the results of the normality tests.**

5.  **Visualize body mass distributions for Gentoo penguins, showing comparisons between males and females using appropriate plots.**

**Hints:**

-   Use `shapiro.test()` for normality tests.

-   Use subsetting or filtering (`subset()` or `dplyr::filter()`) to select Gentoo penguins.

-   Use `ggplot2` or base R plots for visualization.
