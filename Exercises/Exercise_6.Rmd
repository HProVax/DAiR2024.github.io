### Calculating Correlation Between Flipper Length and Body Mass

**Objective:**
We will calculate correlations between Flipper Length and Body Mass using Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman methods in R.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Load the dataset.**

2.  **Calculate the correlation between Flipper Length (`flipper_length_mm`) and Body Mass (`body_mass_g`) using Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman methods.**

3.  **Print and display the correlation coefficients for each method.**

**Hints:**

-   Use `cor()` function in R with the `method` argument set to `"pearson"`, `"kendall"`, and `"spearman"` for calculating correlations.

-   Subset or filter the dataset to include relevant columns (`flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`).
