### For

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Define a vector
x <- c(3, 5, 6, 144)

# Loop through each element in the vector
for (i in x) {
  # Calculate the square of the current item
  y <- i * i
  # Print the square
  print(y)
}

```

```{r}
x[3]
for (i in 1:length(x)){
    print(x[i])
  print(x[i]*x[i])
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
