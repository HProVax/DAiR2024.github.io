Scoring Matrices in Sequence Alignment
Introduction to Scoring Matrices (e.g., PAM, BLOSUM)

Scoring matrices are used to score alignments between amino acid sequences. 
Commonly used matrices include PAM (Point Accepted Mutation) and BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix).
They are standardized matrices widely used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment
```{r}
# Example of loading BLOSUM62 matrix
# BLOSUM62 matrix designed to score alignments of proteins with about 62% sequence identity.
data(BLOSUM62)
print(BLOSUM62)
```

```{r}
# Example of loading PAM250 matrix
# designed for sequences with about 250 accepted point mutations per 100 amino acids.
data(PAM250)
print(PAM250)
```

Impact of Different Matrices on Alignment Outcomes

```{r}
# Load example sequences
seq1 <- AAString("HEAGAWGHEE")
seq2 <- AAString("PAWHEAE")

# Perform pairwise alignment using different matrices
alignment_BLOSUM62 <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, substitutionMatrix = "BLOSUM62")
alignment_PAM30 <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, substitutionMatrix = "PAM30")

print(alignment_BLOSUM62)
print(alignment_PAM30)
```

Local vs. Global Alignment

Differences Between Local and Global Alignment

**Local Alignment**: Local alignment finds the best matching subsequence
                     Useful for finding regions of similarity within long sequences.
                     Smith-Waterman (Local)
**Global Alignment**: Global alignment aligns the entire sequence
                      Useful for comparing sequences that are expected to be similar over their entire length.
                      Needleman-Wunsch (Global)

```{r}
# Perform local alignment using Smith-Waterman algorithm
local_alignment <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type = "local")
print(local_alignment)

# Perform global alignment using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
global_alignment <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type = "global")
print(global_alignment)
```

Gap Penalties

- **Linear**: Each gap is penalized equally.
- **Affine**: Initial gap opening is penalized more heavily than extending an existing gap.

Impact of Gap Penalties on Global Alignment
```{r}
# Perform global alignment with different gap penalties
alignment_linear_gap <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type = "global", gapOpening = 10, gapExtension = 1)
alignment_affine_gap <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type = "global", gapOpening = 10, gapExtension = 0.5)

print(alignment_linear_gap)
print(alignment_affine_gap)
```

Aligning actual SARS Coronavirus Tor2 (NC_004718) vs. SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) 
and saving the results in a text file 
```{r}
# Define the function to fetch and save sequences
fetch_and_save_sequence <- function(id, filename) {
  sequence <- entrez_fetch(db = "nucleotide", id = id, rettype = "fasta", retmode = "text")
  write(sequence, file = filename)
  cat(paste("Sequence fetched and saved to", filename, "\n"))
}

# Fetch and save the sequences for SARS-CoV Tor2 (NC_004718.3)
fetch_and_save_sequence("NC_004718.3", "SARS_CoV_Tor2_1.fasta")
fetch_and_save_sequence("NC_045512.2", "SARS_CoV_2_Wuhan.fasta")

# Read the sequences from the files
seq1 <- readDNAStringSet("SARS_CoV_Tor2_1.fasta")
seq2 <- readDNAStringSet("SARS_CoV_2_Wuhan.fasta")

# Perform global alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
global_alignment <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type="global")

# Perform local alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
local_alignment <- pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, type="local")

# Print the results
print("Global Alignment:")
print(global_alignment)
# Calculate percentage identity
pid(global_alignment)

print("Local Alignment:")
print(local_alignment)

# Optionally, save the alignments to files
writePairwiseAlignments(global_alignment, file="global_alignment.txt")
writePairwiseAlignments(local_alignment, file="local_alignment.txt")
```


Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithms: 

- ClustalW is a widely-used multiple sequence alignment tool known for its simplicity and effectiveness, providing hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic tree construction.

- MUSCLE (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) offers more accurate alignments, especially for large datasets, and is faster than ClustalW due to its iterative refinement technique.

In summary, while ClustalW is easier to use and integrates well with phylogenetic analysis, MUSCLE is preferred for its speed and accuracy in aligning larger and more complex datasets.

```{r}
# Load example sequences
sequences <- DNAStringSet(c("ATGCTAGCTAG", "ATGCTAGCTAA", "ATGCTAGATAG"))

# Perform multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW
msa_clustal <- msa(sequences, method = "ClustalW")
print(msa_clustal)
```

```{r}
# Perform multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE
msa_muscle <- msa(sequences, method = "Muscle")

# Print the alignment result
print(msa_muscle)
```

Perform MSA Using ClustalW with Three Sequences:SARS-CoV Tor2, SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, and MERS-CoV
```{r}
# Fetch and save the sequences for MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3)
fetch_and_save_sequence("NC_019843.3", "MERS_CoV.fasta")

# Read the sequences from the files
seq1 <- readDNAStringSet("SARS_CoV_Tor2_1.fasta")
seq2 <- readDNAStringSet("SARS_CoV_2_Wuhan.fasta")
seq3 <- readDNAStringSet("MERS_CoV.fasta")

# Combine the sequences into one object
sequences <- c(seq1, seq2, seq3)

# Perform multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW
msa_clustal <- msa(sequences, method = "ClustalW")

# Print the alignment result
print(msa_clustal)

# Save the ClustalW alignment to a text file
writeXStringSet(as(msa_clustal, "DNAStringSet"), filepath = "msa_clustal_output.txt")

# Perform multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE
msa_muscle <- msa(sequences, method = "Muscle")

# Print the alignment result
print(msa_muscle)

# Save the MUSCLE alignment to a text file
writeXStringSet(as(msa_muscle, "DNAStringSet"), filepath = "msa_muscle_output.txt")
```

Phylogenetic Tree Construction Methods

1. Distance-Based Methods (e.g., Neighbor-Joining, UPGMA)

Neighbor-Joining (NJ) is a distance-based method for phylogenetic tree construction that is particularly effective for large datasets and accommodates varying rates of evolution across lineages, aiming to minimize the total branch length of the tree.

UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) is a simpler, hierarchical clustering method that assumes a constant rate of evolution (molecular clock) across all lineages, which can lead to inaccuracies if the rate of evolution varies among lineages.

In summary, NJ is preferred for its flexibility and accuracy with varying evolutionary rates, while UPGMA is straightforward but relies on the molecular clock assumption, making it less accurate under varying rates of evolution.

```{r}
# Generate a dummy DNA sequence dataset
sequences <- DNAStringSet(c(
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTG",  # Japanese Pufferfish
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTC",  # Green-spotted Pufferfish
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGTA",  # Zebrafish
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGTC",  # Frog
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGTT",      # Chicken
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCGG",  # Human
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCGG",  # Chimpanzee
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTC",  # Cattle
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGTTA",      # Rats
  "ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGTTT"       # Mice
))

# Perform multiple sequence alignment
alignment <- msa(sequences)

# Convert alignment to distance matrix
dist_matrix <- dist.ml(as.phyDat(alignment))

# Construct phylogenetic trees using Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA methods
tree_nj <- nj(dist_matrix)
tree_upgma <- upgma(dist_matrix)

# Set species names
species_names <- c("Japanese Pufferfish", "Green-spotted Pufferfish",
                   "Zebrafish", "Frog", "Chicken", "Human",
                   "Chimpanzee", "Cattle", "Rats", "Mice")

# Assign species names to trees
tree_nj$tip.label <- species_names
tree_upgma$tip.label <- species_names

)

# Function to read and truncate sequences to 50bp
read_and_truncate_sequence <- function(filename) {
  seq <- readDNAStringSet(filepath = filename)
  subseq(seq, start = 1, end = 50)
}

# Read and truncate sequences
sequences <- lapply(filenames, read_and_truncate_sequence)
sequences <- do.call(c, sequences)

# Perform multiple sequence alignment

bs_tree <- bootstrap.pml(ml_fit, bs = 100)  # Perform bootstrap
plotBS(midpoint(ml_fit$tree), bs_tree, main = "Bayesian-like (Bootstrap) Tree")

# Bootstrapping assesses the reliability of phylogenetic trees by resampling data
```
