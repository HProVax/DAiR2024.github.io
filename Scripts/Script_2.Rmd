# Data types in R

## Binding

This code

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

snippet accomplishes two tasks:

-   It creates an object, specifically a vector of values, `c(1, 2, 3)`.

-   It assigns that object to a name, `x`.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In other words, the name `x` is assigned a value (the object or vector `c(1, 2, 3)`) using the assignment operator `<-`, which is an arrow points in the opposite direction of the assignment.

    ```{r}
    y <- x 
    lobstr::obj_addr(x)
    lobstr::obj_addr(y)
    ```

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
